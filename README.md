Test respository for github and sourcetree learnings.

Ross is currently working on learning the proper usage of source control using open source tools like SourceTree and GitHub.

Ross is now making local edits within Notepad++ and hopes saving this file will affect File Status within SourceTree

Ross created a branch from the develop branch after committing changes within the develop branch. Admittedly, he's kind of lost right now.

Ross hates the edit for the expirimental branch probably because he can't even spell that word... and he thinks he's catching up with this a bit, but is still not certain.

Ross made a change to the develop branch, which I think I can commit seperately than lines 10 and 8 above, but again, uncertaintity permeates this entire endeavor.

I pulled up my branch from yesterday to see if those commits merged and they did. Fun! Again, I can now spell this experiment albeit it's from cut and paste. experiment. Now it's tab complete.
